# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. These have been altered to better suit my 1440p monitor. Please adjust font
sizes as needed.

Each folder in this repository should be symlinked to your config folder.
 - Example: neovim
```
ln -s $HOME/<path to dotfiles folder>/nvim $HOME/.config/nvim
```

### IMPORTANT
Remember that when symlinking, you must use absolute paths. Relative paths will not work.
